# Car-vs-Airplane-prediction-using-Neural-Networks---Computer-Vision

### View the html file for better understanding of the working of model
### I have named all the car images as c1.jpg, c2.jpg...... and Airplane images as p1.jpg, p2.jpg......
### test_car.jpg, test_plane.jpg .... are the random images from web to test the model.

### This project can be broken down into certain tasks as follows:

Task 1: Loading the Images.

Task 2: Pre-processing images using the EBImage package in R.

Task 3: Reshaping the images using a Keras function called array_reshape().

Task 4: Creating Testing and Training sets.

Task 5: Creating a classifier using one hot encoding.

Task 6: Building the architecture for the Neural Network. Rectified Linear Unit ("RELU") and SoftMax.

Task 7: Building a loss optimizer function using cross_entropy.

Task 8: Test to see how the model performed using a Confusion Matrix.

Task 9: Loading random images from web and cheching the results of prediction.
